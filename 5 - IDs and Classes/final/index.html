<!-- 
  Difference between class and ID
  You want to think of ID's as elements that aren't going to be put anywhere else, or in other words - unique.
  If you have a navbar, which is a pretty unique component in the application, you're probably aren't going to have another navbar anywhere else on the page, so it's safe to give it an ID.
  In contrast, if you are using a box and you may want to reuse the styling of that box somewhere else, it won't be unique so we would use a class.
  ID's - unique | Classes - reusable.
  You can also always use classes (like Bootstrap).
  The bottom line is you don't want to repeat ID's.
